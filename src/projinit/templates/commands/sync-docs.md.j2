## User Input

$ARGUMENTS
```

## Purpose

Update user-facing documentation to reflect the current state of the project after implementing new features or making significant changes.

## Scope

This command updates:

| File | Content Updated |
|------|-----------------|
| `README.md` | Features, commands, usage examples, installation |
| `constitution.md` | Architecture, patterns, technical decisions (if exists) |

## Execution Steps

1. **Analyze current project state**:
   - Read source files to identify features and commands
{% if project_type in ["python-cli", "python-lib"] %}
   - Check `pyproject.toml` for dependencies and scripts
   - Scan `src/{{ project_name_snake }}/` for modules and CLI commands
{% elif project_type == "node-frontend" %}
   - Check `package.json` for scripts and dependencies
   - Scan `src/` for components and features
{% elif project_type == "infrastructure" %}
   - Check `terraform/` for resources and variables
   - Check `ansible/` for playbooks and roles
{% endif %}

2. **Update README.md**:
   - Verify installation instructions are current
   - Update feature list if new features added
   - Update usage examples if API changed
   - Ensure all commands are documented

3. **Update constitution.md** (if exists):
   - Update architecture section if structure changed
   - Add new patterns or conventions used
   - Document new technical decisions

4. **Report changes**:
   - List sections updated
   - Highlight any manual review needed

## When to Run

- After implementing a new feature
- After adding new commands or API endpoints
- After changing project structure
- Before creating a release

## Guidelines

- Preserve existing documentation style
- Add new content, don't remove existing unless outdated
- Use consistent formatting (ASCII-safe if current docs use it)
- Keep examples up to date with actual code
